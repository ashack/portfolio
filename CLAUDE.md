## Original Specification

Generate a complete Ruby on Rails 8 SaaS application with the following exact specifications:

## Application Architecture

### Core Concept
- **Triple-track SaaS application** with three distinct user ecosystems:
  - **Direct Users**: Individual users with personal billing who can also create teams
  - **Invited Users**: Team members who join via invitation only  
  - **Enterprise Users**: Large organizations with enterprise plans (invitation-based)
- **Teams operate independently** with their own URLs, billing, and members
- **Enterprise groups operate independently** with dedicated management interfaces
- **Individual users operate independently** with personal billing and features
- **Direct users CAN create and own teams** while maintaining individual features
- **No crossover** between invited team members and individual user features
- **Enterprise users are separate** from both direct and team users

### User Types & Access Patterns

#### System Administration Users
1. **Super Admin**
   - Platform owner with complete system access
   - Can create teams and enterprise groups
   - Can manage all users, teams, and enterprise organizations
   - Access: `/admin/super/dashboard`

2. **Site Admin** 
   - Customer support and user management
   - Cannot create teams or enterprise groups (read-only access)
   - Cannot modify billing but can view organization details
   - Can manage user status and provide support
   - Can view both teams and enterprise groups for support
   - Access: `/admin/site/dashboard`

#### Individual Users (Direct Registration)
3. **Direct User**
   - Registers independently via public signup
   - Can choose individual or team plans
   - Has personal Stripe subscription and billing
   - CAN create and own teams while maintaining individual features
   - Cannot join teams via invitation (but can create their own)
   - Access: `/dashboard` (individual) or `/teams/team-slug/` (if owns team)

#### Team-Based Users (Invitation Only)
4. **Team Admin**
   - Can be either:
     - Direct user who created a team (owns_team: true)
     - Invited user with admin role assigned
   - Manages team billing, settings, and members
   - Can invite new users (new emails only) and delete team members
   - Can revoke pending invitations (but not accepted ones)
   - Access: `/teams/team-slug/admin`

5. **Team Member**
   - Created through Team Admin invitation to new email addresses
   - No billing access, limited team permissions
   - Cannot become individual user or join other teams
   - Access: `/teams/team-slug/`

#### Enterprise Users (Invitation Only)
6. **Enterprise Admin**
   - Manages enterprise organization
   - Invited via email by Super Admin during group creation
   - Full access to member management, billing, and settings
   - Can invite/remove members and manage roles
   - Access: `/enterprise/enterprise-slug/`
   
7. **Enterprise Member**
   - Part of enterprise organization
   - Invited by Enterprise Admin
   - Standard access to enterprise features
   - Cannot access billing or member management
   - Access: `/enterprise/enterprise-slug/`

## Authorization & Security

**ðŸ“š See [Authentication & Authorization Documentation](docs/architecture/04-authentication.md) for complete security details**

### Key Security Features:
- **Authentication**: Devise with 8 security modules
- **Authorization**: Pundit policy-based system
- **Rate Limiting**: Comprehensive Rack::Attack configuration with Fail2Ban
- **Email Security**: Email change approval workflow with 30-day expiration
- **Activity Tracking**: Background job-based with 5-minute Redis cache
- **Session Security**: Server-side sessions, CSRF protection, secure cookies

### Security Documentation:
- **[Security Overview](docs/security/README.md)** - Complete security architecture
- **[Authentication Guide](docs/security/authentication.md)** - Devise configuration
- **[Authorization Guide](docs/security/authorization.md)** - Pundit policies
- **[Rack::Attack Config](docs/security/rack-attack.md)** - Rate limiting details

## Billing Integration

**ðŸ’³ Stripe & Pay Gem Integration**

The application uses the Pay gem for comprehensive billing:
- **Individual Plans**: Free, Pro ($19/mo), Premium ($49/mo)
- **Team Plans**: Starter ($49/mo, 5 users), Pro ($99/mo, 15 users), Enterprise ($199/mo, 100 users)
- **Enterprise Plans**: Custom pricing and features

Billing is completely separated between user types with polymorphic Pay::Billable implementation.

## Model Architecture

**ðŸ“š See [User Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture/02-user-architecture.md) for complete model details**

The application implements a sophisticated triple-track user system with these core models:

- **User**: Polymorphic behavior based on user_type (direct, invited, enterprise)
- **Team**: Multi-tenant teams with Stripe billing integration
- **EnterpriseGroup**: Large organization management
- **Invitation**: Polymorphic invitations for teams and enterprises
- **EmailChangeRequest**: Secure email change workflow
- **AuditLog**: Comprehensive activity tracking

All models are implemented with proper validations, callbacks, and business logic enforcement at the database level.

## Service Objects & Business Logic

**ðŸ“š See [Business Logic Guide](docs/guides/business-logic.md) for service object patterns**

The application uses service objects for complex operations:

- **Teams::CreationService** - Team creation with admin assignment
- **Users::StatusManagementService** - User status changes with audit logging
- **EmailChangeService** - Secure email change workflow
- **InvitationService** - Polymorphic invitation handling
- **AuditLogService** - Centralized audit logging

All service objects follow the same pattern with `call` method and success/failure responses.

## Environment Configuration

**ðŸ”§ See `.env.example` for required environment variables**

Key configuration areas:
- **Stripe**: API keys and webhook secrets
- **Email**: SMTP settings for production
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for production
- **Redis**: Caching and background jobs
- **Security**: Secret keys and tokens

## Deployment & Production

**ðŸš€ Production Deployment Requirements:**

- **Infrastructure**: Docker-ready with Kamal deployment support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper migrations strategy
- **Background Jobs**: Solid Queue with Redis
- **Monitoring**: Ahoy analytics with team context tracking
- **Performance**: 50+ database indexes, query optimization
- **Security**: Rack::Attack rate limiting, secure headers

**Pending Production Tasks:**
- [ ] Production Stripe webhook setup
- [ ] Email delivery configuration
- [ ] Redis production configuration
- [ ] PostgreSQL migration from SQLite

## Development Guidelines
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User
- Always run linting after making changes
- Write tests for new functionality
- Try to update the files if existing rather than creating new files to avoid duplicacy. This is especially useful for docs and test files
