### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd saas_ror_starter
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
bundle install
```

3. Setup database
```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

4. Configure environment variables
```bash
# Create .env file with:
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_stripe_webhook_secret
```

5. Start the server
```bash
bin/dev
```

### Default Credentials

After running seeds, you'll have a super admin account:
- Email: super@admin.com
- Password: Password123!

## Usage

### Creating Teams
#### Method 1: Super Admin Creation
1. Login as super admin
2. Navigate to /admin/super/dashboard
3. Click "Create New Team"
4. Assign an existing user as team admin

#### Method 2: Direct User Creation
1. Register as direct user
2. Select a team plan during registration
3. Enter team name when prompted
4. Automatically become team admin

### User Registration Flows
- **Direct Users**: Register via public signup at /users/sign_up
- **Team Members**: Must be invited by team admin (invitation-only)
- **Enterprise Users**: Must be invited by enterprise admin (invitation-only)

### Creating Enterprise Organizations (Super Admin Only)
1. Login as super admin
2. Navigate to /admin/super/dashboard
3. Click "Enterprise Groups" tab
4. Create new enterprise group
5. Send invitation to designated admin
6. Admin accepts invitation and gains full access

### Important Business Rules
1. Direct users CANNOT join teams via invitation (but can create their own teams)
2. Team members CANNOT become direct users
3. Only super admins can create teams (except direct users creating during registration)
4. Team admins can delete team members completely
5. Invitations can only be sent to new email addresses
6. Enterprise users are completely separate from team/individual systems
7. Enterprise admins are assigned via invitation during group creation

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests with accurate coverage reporting
PARALLEL_WORKERS=1 bundle exec rails test

# Run specific test files
bundle exec rails test test/models/user_test.rb

# Run with verbose output
bundle exec rails test -v

# Run a specific test method
bundle exec rails test test/models/user_test.rb -n test_should_be_valid_with_valid_attributes
```

### Code Coverage
SimpleCov is configured to generate coverage reports automatically when running tests.

**Current Coverage**: 24.02% line coverage, 65.12% branch coverage
**Test Suite**: 505 tests, 1438 assertions, 14 failures (mostly design issues)

```bash
# After running tests, view coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

Coverage configuration includes:
- Branch coverage tracking
- Separate groups for models, controllers, services, etc.
- HTML reports with detailed line-by-line coverage

### Writing Tests
The project uses Minitest for testing with the following helpers:

```ruby
# Sign in a user in tests
sign_in_as(user)

# Create and sign in a user with specific attributes
user = sign_in_with(
  email: "test@example.com",
  system_role: "super_admin",
  user_type: "direct"
)
```

### Test Structure
```
test/
â”œâ”€â”€ application_system_test_case.rb  # Base class for system tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_helper.rb                   # Test configuration and helpers
â”œâ”€â”€ models/                          # Model tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user_test.rb
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/                     # Controller tests
â”œâ”€â”€ system/                          # System/integration tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user_registration_test.rb
â””â”€â”€ fixtures/                        # Test data
```

## Deployment

### Docker
```bash
docker build -t saas_app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e RAILS_MASTER_KEY=<your-key> saas_app
```

### Kamal
```bash
kamal setup
kamal deploy
```

## Security Configuration

### Rack::Attack Protection
The application includes comprehensive rate limiting and security filtering:

#### Rate Limits
- **General requests**: 60/minute per IP
- **Login attempts**: 5/20 seconds per IP
- **Password resets**: 5/hour per IP  
- **Sign ups**: 3/hour per IP
- **Team invitations**: 20/day per user
- **Enterprise invitations**: 30/day per user
- **Enterprise admin actions**: 100/hour per user

#### Security Filters
- **Blocked paths**: Common vulnerability scans (wp-admin, .env, .git, etc.)
- **Blocked user agents**: Known scanners and bots
- **Fail2Ban**: Auto-blocks IPs after 3 failed logins

### Environment Variables for Security
```bash
# Add to .env for production
ALLOWED_IPS=192.168.1.100,10.0.0.50  # Whitelist IPs
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0    # For distributed rate limiting
```

## Code Quality

### Linting
The project uses RuboCop with Rails Omakase standards:

```bash
# Run linting
bundle exec rubocop

# Auto-correct issues
bundle exec rubocop --autocorrect

# Run specific file/directory
bundle exec rubocop app/models/
```

### Security Scanning
```bash
# Run Brakeman security scanner
bundle exec brakeman

# Run with detailed output
bundle exec brakeman -A
```
