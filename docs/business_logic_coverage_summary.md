## High Risk Uncovered Rules ⚠️

These critical business rules have HIGH risk but NO test coverage:

1. **CR-T4**: Team billing independence (Weight: 9)
   - Teams have their own Stripe subscriptions separate from individuals
   - Risk: Revenue tracking and billing accuracy issues

2. **CR-S1**: CSRF protection (Weight: 9)
   - All state-changing requests must include CSRF token
   - Risk: Request forgery vulnerabilities

3. **CR-S2**: Mass assignment protection (Weight: 9)
   - User-supplied parameters must be explicitly permitted
   - Risk: Privilege escalation through parameter manipulation

4. **CR-B2**: Plan enforcement - features and limits (Weight: 6)
   - Features and limits must match the active plan
   - Risk: Revenue protection and feature access violations

5. **CR-D1**: Foreign key integrity (Weight: 8)
   - All associations must maintain referential integrity
   - Risk: Orphaned records and data corruption

## Well-Covered Areas ✅

- **User Type System**: 100% coverage of critical rules
  - User type immutability (CR-U1)
  - User type isolation (CR-U2, CR-U3)
  - Direct user team ownership (CR-U5)
  - User type transitions (IR-U1, IR-U2)

- **Authentication & Security**: 85% coverage of critical rules
  - Password complexity (CR-A1)
  - System role hierarchy (CR-A2)
  - Self-role change prevention (CR-A3) ✨ NEW
  - Status enforcement (CR-A4)
  - Admin-only role assignment (CR-A5)

- **Invitation System**: 100% coverage of critical rules
  - Email validation (CR-I1)
  - Expiration validation (CR-I2)
  - Polymorphic safety (CR-I3)
  - User creation on acceptance (CR-I4)
  - Revocation rules (CR-I5) ✨ NEW

- **Enterprise System**: 100% coverage of critical rules
  - Admin assignment via invitation (CR-E1) ✨ NEW
  - Enterprise user isolation (CR-E2) ✨ NEW

- **Audit Logging**: 100% coverage of critical rules
  - All critical operations logged (CR-AU1)
  - Immutable audit trail (CR-AU2)
  - Security event tracking (CR-AU3)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (Critical Gaps)
1. Implement team billing independence tests (CR-T4)
   - Verify Stripe subscriptions are separate for teams and individuals
   - Test billing isolation between entities

### Security Priority
1. Add CSRF protection tests (CR-S1)
   - Verify all state-changing requests require CSRF tokens
   - Test rejection of requests without valid tokens

2. Implement mass assignment protection tests (CR-S2)
   - Verify strong parameters are enforced
   - Test that unpermitted parameters are filtered

### Infrastructure Priority
1. Add foreign key integrity tests (CR-D1)
   - Test cascade rules and dependent destroy behavior
   - Verify orphaned record prevention

2. Add plan enforcement validation tests (CR-B2)
   - Test feature access based on active plan
   - Verify member limits are enforced

### Coverage Goals
- ✅ Achieved: 84.2% coverage for Weight 9-10 rules (Target: 90%)
- ✅ Maintained: 80% coverage for Weight 6-8 rules (Target: 80%)
- Current gap: Need 3 more critical tests to reach 90% target
