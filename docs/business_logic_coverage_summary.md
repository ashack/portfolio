- **Covered**: 11 rules (57.9%)
- **Uncovered**: 8 rules (42.1%)

- **Uncovered**: 2 rules (20.0%)

## High Risk Uncovered Rules ⚠️

These critical business rules have HIGH risk but NO test coverage:

1. **CR-A3**: Self-role change prevention (Weight: 9)
   - Admins CANNOT change their own system role
   - Risk: Privilege escalation vulnerability

2. **CR-T4**: Team billing independence (Weight: 9)
   - Teams have their own Stripe subscriptions separate from individuals
   - Risk: Revenue tracking and billing accuracy issues

3. **CR-E1**: Admin assignment via invitation (Weight: 9)
   - Enterprise admins MUST be assigned through invitation acceptance
   - Risk: Circular dependency and access control issues

4. **CR-E2**: Enterprise user isolation (Weight: 9)
   - Enterprise users CANNOT have team associations
   - Risk: Billing and access control contamination

5. **CR-B2**: Plan enforcement - features and limits (Weight: 9)
   - Features and limits must match the active plan
   - Risk: Revenue protection and feature access violations

6. **CR-S1**: CSRF protection (Weight: 9)
   - All state-changing requests must include CSRF token
   - Risk: Request forgery vulnerabilities

7. **CR-S2**: Mass assignment protection (Weight: 9)
   - User-supplied parameters must be explicitly permitted
   - Risk: Privilege escalation through parameter manipulation

8. **CR-D1**: Foreign key integrity (Weight: 8)
   - All associations must maintain referential integrity
   - Risk: Orphaned records and data corruption

## Well-Covered Areas ✅

These critical areas have good test coverage:

- **User Type System**: 80% coverage of critical rules
  - User type immutability
  - User type isolation
  - Direct user team ownership

- **Authentication**: 66% coverage of critical rules
  - Password complexity
  - System role hierarchy

- **Invitation System**: 75% coverage of critical rules
  - Email validation
  - Polymorphic safety
  - User creation on acceptance

## Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (Critical Gaps)
1. Add tests for self-role change prevention
2. Implement team billing independence tests
3. Create enterprise isolation tests
4. Add plan enforcement validation tests

### Security Priority
1. Add CSRF protection tests
2. Implement mass assignment protection tests
3. Add foreign key integrity tests

### Coverage Goals
- Target: 90% coverage for Weight 9-10 rules
- Target: 80% coverage for Weight 6-8 rules
- Current gap: Need 8 more critical tests to reach target

## Test Distribution

- **Total Tests**: 370
- **Matched to Business Rules**: 40 tests
- **Unmatched Tests**: 330 tests

Many tests exist but aren't directly mapped to documented business rules. This suggests either:
1. Tests for undocumented business logic
2. Tests for implementation details rather than business rules
3. Opportunity to better align tests with business requirements
