## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
1. **Low Test Coverage**: Increases bug risk in production
2. **Missing Production Config**: Blocks deployment
3. **No CI/CD**: Manual deployment prone to errors

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Testing Sprint**: Dedicated 2-week testing effort
2. **DevOps Setup**: Prioritize infrastructure tasks
3. **Automation**: Implement CI/CD pipeline ASAP

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Complete production configuration (1 week)
2. Write controller and system tests (2 weeks)
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline (3 days)
4. Deploy to staging environment (1 day)

### Before Launch
1. Security penetration testing
2. Load testing with realistic data
3. Complete documentation
4. Train support team

### Post-Launch
1. Monitor performance metrics
2. Gather user feedback
3. Iterate on UI/UX
4. Plan feature roadmap
