- **After**: 3 tests, 60 lines
- **Removed**: Framework verifications, redundant routing tests
- **Kept**: User type routing matrix, team routing, public access

### Users::DashboardControllerTest  
- **Before**: 12 tests, 165 lines
- **After**: 4 tests, 93 lines
- **Removed**: Redundant admin tests, activity ordering details
- **Kept**: Critical access control, authentication, payment handling
