# Recent Updates Summary

*Last Updated: January 2025*

## Overview

This document summarizes the major updates made to the SaaS Rails Starter application, transforming it from a dual-track system to a comprehensive triple-track system with enterprise support.

## Major Architectural Changes

### 1. Triple-Track User System
