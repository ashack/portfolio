bundle exec rails test
open coverage/index.html

# Generate business rule coverage
bundle exec rails test:coverage:business_rules

# Generate test weight report
bundle exec rails test:coverage:weights
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Add missing critical tests** for uncovered Weight 9-10 rules
2. **Fix skipped tests** especially AdminActivityLog tests
3. **Implement CSRF and mass assignment tests** for all controllers
4. **Create integration tests** for billing isolation

### Process Improvements
1. **Require tests** for all new business rules
2. **Block PRs** that reduce critical rule coverage
3. **Weekly review** of coverage metrics
4. **Quarterly optimization** of test suite

### Tooling Enhancements
1. **Automate** business rule coverage tracking
2. **Add pre-commit hooks** for test coverage
3. **Create dashboards** for coverage trends
4. **Implement** mutation testing for critical paths
