## Test Distribution

### By Component
| Component | Tests | Coverage | Focus |
|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| Models | 245 | 78% | Business rules, validations |
| Controllers | 98 | 65% | Auth, authorization |
| Services | 42 | 82% | Complex workflows |
| Integration | 28 | N/A | User journeys |
| System | 15 | N/A | End-to-end flows |

### By Priority Weight
| Weight | Category | Tests | % of Total |
|--------|----------|-------|------------|
| 9-10 | Critical | 89 | 20.8% |
| 7-8 | High | 127 | 29.7% |
| 5-6 | Medium | 142 | 33.2% |
| 3-4 | Low | 56 | 13.1% |
| 1-2 | Trivial | 14 | 3.3% |

## High-Risk Gaps

### Critical Missing Coverage (Weight 9-10)
1. **CR-T4**: Team billing independence - Stripe isolation
2. **CR-S1**: CSRF protection - Security headers
3. **CR-S2**: Mass assignment protection - Strong parameters

### Important Missing Coverage (Weight 6-8)
1. **CR-B2**: Plan feature enforcement - Access control
2. **CR-D1**: Foreign key integrity - Data consistency

## Well-Covered Areas

### 100% Coverage Achieved
- User Type System (CR-U series)
- Invitation System (CR-I series)
- Enterprise System (CR-E series)
- Audit Logging (CR-AU series)

### High Coverage (85%+)
- Authentication & Security
- Team Management
- User Status Management

## Optimization Impact

### Before Optimization
- **Total Tests**: 600+
- **High-Value Tests**: 30%
- **Test Execution**: 8-10 minutes
- **Maintenance Burden**: High

### After Optimization
- **Total Tests**: 428 (-28.7%)
- **High-Value Tests**: 50.5%
- **Test Execution**: 3-4 minutes
- **Maintenance Burden**: Low

### Key Improvements
1. **70% reduction** in low-value tests
2. **65% faster** execution time
3. **45% fewer** lines of test code
4. **100% coverage** of critical user flows

## Recent Achievements

### June 2025 Progress
- Added 58 new tests for critical rules
- Fixed all test failures
- Improved coverage from 65.5% to 82.8%
- Achieved 100% coverage for user and invitation systems
- Implemented comprehensive audit logging tests

### Test Quality Improvements
- All tests now reference business rules
- Weight-based prioritization implemented
- Consolidated redundant test cases
- Added missing edge case coverage

## Skipped Tests Analysis

| Model | Count | Reason | Weight | Priority |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| User | 2 | ID comparison in test env | 5 | Medium |
| Invitation | 2 | ID comparison in test env | 6 | Medium |
| AdminActivityLog | 3 | ActiveRecord relations | 7 | High |

## Action Plan

### Immediate (1-2 weeks)
1. Add CSRF protection tests
2. Add mass assignment tests
3. Fix AdminActivityLog skipped tests

### Short-term (1 month)
1. Add team billing isolation tests
2. Implement plan enforcement tests
3. Reach 90% critical rule coverage

### Medium-term (3 months)
1. Add foreign key integrity tests
2. Implement branch coverage tracking
3. Create performance benchmarks
