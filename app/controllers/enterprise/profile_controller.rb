# Enterprise::ProfileController
#
# Manages individual user profiles within enterprise organizations in the triple-track SaaS system.
# Handles personal profile management for enterprise users while maintaining enterprise context
# and isolation from direct user and team user profile management.
#
# **Access Control:**
# - Available to ALL enterprise users (both admins and members)
# - Users can only edit their own profiles (no cross-user profile editing)
# - Inherits authentication from ApplicationController
# - Enterprise user validation prevents non-enterprise access
#
# **Profile Management vs Other Systems:**
# - Enterprise user profiles are separate from direct user profiles (/dashboard/profile)
# - Different from team user profiles (/teams/:slug/profile)
# - Enterprise context maintained via enterprise_group_slug in URLs
# - Profile data shared across enterprise but isolated from other user types
#
# **Email Change Security:**
# - Integrates EmailChangeProtection concern for secure email changes
# - Email changes require approval workflow (not immediate)
# - Prevents unauthorized email changes and account takeovers
# - Maintains audit trail for email change requests
#
# **Profile Features:**
# - Personal information (name, bio, contact details)
# - Avatar and profile image management
# - Social media links and professional URLs
# - Timezone and locale preferences
# - Notification preferences (enterprise-specific)
# - Profile completion tracking and scoring
#
# **Enterprise Integration:**
# - Profile visibility controlled by enterprise settings
# - Enterprise branding and theme (purple color scheme)
# - Enterprise group context for navigation and URLs
# - Integration with enterprise member directory
#
# **URL Structure:**
# Routes scoped under /enterprise/:enterprise_group_slug/profile/
# - Maintains enterprise context in all profile operations
# - Multi-tenant profile management via enterprise group slug

  # Validates that current user is an enterprise user
  #
  # **Validation Logic:**
  # - Only users with user_type: 'enterprise' can access profiles
  # - Direct users are blocked from enterprise profile access
  # - Team users are blocked from enterprise profile access
  # - Enforces triple-track system isolation
  #
  # **Redirects:**
  # - Non-enterprise users â†’ root_path with access denied message

    redirect_to root_path, alert: "Access denied." unless current_user.enterprise?
  end

  # Sets enterprise group context for profile operations
  #
  # **Context Setting:**
  # - Uses current_user.enterprise_group association
  # - Provides enterprise context for URLs and branding
  # - Required for enterprise-specific profile features
  # - Maintains multi-tenant isolation
