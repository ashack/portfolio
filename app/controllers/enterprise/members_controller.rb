# Enterprise::MembersController
#
# Manages enterprise organization members and invitations within the triple-track SaaS system.
# Handles member management, role assignments, and invitation workflows specifically for
# enterprise organizations, completely separate from team member management.
#
# **Access Control:**
# - index, show: Available to ALL enterprise users (members and admins)
# - new, create, edit, update, destroy: RESTRICTED to Enterprise Admins only
# - Invitation management: Enterprise Admins only
# - Inherits enterprise user validation from Enterprise::BaseController
#
# **Enterprise vs Team Member Management:**
# - Enterprise members are created through enterprise-specific invitations
# - Completely isolated from team member management (/teams/:slug/admin/members)
# - Different role structure: 'admin' vs 'member' (not team roles)
# - Enterprise invitations use invitation_type: 'enterprise'
# - No crossover with direct users or team users
#
# **Member Lifecycle:**
# 1. Enterprise Admin sends invitation to email address
# 2. Invitation email sent with enterprise-specific branding
# 3. Recipient accepts invitation and becomes enterprise user
# 4. User assigned to enterprise group with specified role
# 5. Admin can update roles or remove members
#
# **Invitation System:**
# - Uses polymorphic Invitation model (invitable: enterprise_group)
# - Email validation prevents duplicate invitations
# - 7-day expiration on pending invitations
# - Resend and revoke functionality for pending invitations only
#
# **Business Rules:**
# - Only NEW email addresses can be invited (no existing users)
# - Enterprise admins cannot remove themselves
# - Invitation emails use enterprise-specific templates
# - Members cannot invite other members (admin privilege only)
#
# **URL Structure:**
# All routes scoped under /enterprise/:enterprise_group_slug/members/
# - Multi-tenant member management via enterprise group slug
class Enterprise::MembersController < Enterprise::BaseController
  # Restrict admin actions to enterprise admins only

  #
  # **Displays:**
  # - Current enterprise group members with activity tracking
  # - Pending invitations with invitation details
  # - Separate pagination for members and invitations
  #
  # **Access:**
  # - Available to all enterprise users (members can see other members)
  # - Admin controls displayed only for enterprise admins
  #
  # **Data Loading:**
  # - Includes :ahoy_visits for last activity tracking

  # - Ordered by creation date for consistent listing

  # - Pre-populates enterprise-specific invitation defaults

  # Creates and sends enterprise invitation
  #
  # **Business Logic:**
  # - Validates email is not already in use (enforced by Invitation model)
  # - Sets invitation_type: 'enterprise' for polymorphic routing
  # - Associates invitation with current enterprise group
  # - Records the inviting admin for audit trail
  #
  # **Email Integration:**
  # - Sends enterprise-specific invitation email immediately
  # - Uses enterprise branding and messaging
  # - Includes enterprise group context and role information
  #
  # **Validation:**
  # - Email format validation
  # - Duplicate email prevention
  # - Role validation (admin or member)

  # Edit member role form
  #
  # **Access:**
  # - Enterprise Admins only
  # - Allows updating member roles between 'admin' and 'member'
  # - Cannot edit own role to prevent admin lockout
  def edit
    # Edit member role
  end

  # Updates member role within enterprise group
  #
  # **Role Management:**
  # - Updates enterprise_group_role (admin or member)
  # - Role changes take effect immediately
  # - Affects user permissions across enterprise system
  #
  # **Business Rules:**
  # - Only enterprise admins can update roles
  # - Role changes are logged for audit trail
  # - Cannot demote last admin (business rule enforcement needed)

    end
  end

  # Removes member from enterprise group
  #
  # **Removal Logic:**
  # - Completely removes user from enterprise system
  # - User account is deleted (not just removed from enterprise)
  # - Self-removal protection prevents admin lockout
  # - Different from team member removal (teams keep user account)
  #
  # **Business Rules:**
  # - Enterprise admins cannot remove themselves
  # - Member removal is permanent and irreversible
  # - All member data and access is immediately revoked

  # Resends invitation email to pending invitee
  #
  # **Business Logic:**
  # - Only works for pending invitations (not accepted)
  # - Resets invitation expiration timer
  # - Uses same invitation token and details
  # - Helpful for missed or expired invitations
  #
  # **Email Integration:**
  # - Sends fresh invitation email with enterprise branding
  # - Same invitation URL and acceptance process
  # - Does not create duplicate invitations

  # Revokes pending invitation before acceptance
  #
  # **Revocation Logic:**
  # - Permanently deletes pending invitation
  # - Prevents invitation acceptance after revocation
  # - Only works for pending invitations (not accepted)
  # - Cannot revoke invitations after user has joined
  #
  # **Use Cases:**
  # - Invitation sent to wrong email address
  # - Role requirements changed before acceptance
  # - Security concerns about pending invitations
