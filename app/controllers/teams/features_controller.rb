# Teams::FeaturesController - Team feature access and configuration management
#
# PURPOSE:
# - Manages team-specific feature access and configuration
# - Displays available features based on team's subscription plan
# - Handles feature requests and configuration updates
# - Provides feature-specific functionality for team members
#
# ACCESS LEVEL: Team Member
# - Available to all team members (both regular members and admins)
# - Feature configuration may require admin privileges (implementation pending)
# - Feature viewing is open to all team members
#
# ROUTE STRUCTURE:
# - GET /teams/:team_slug/features (index)
# - GET /teams/:team_slug/features/:id (show)
# - GET /teams/:team_slug/features/new (new)
# - POST /teams/:team_slug/features (create)
# - GET /teams/:team_slug/features/:id/edit (edit)
# - PATCH /teams/:team_slug/features/:id (update)
# - DELETE /teams/:team_slug/features/:id (destroy)
#
# TRIPLE-TRACK USER INTEGRATION:
# - INVITED USERS: Primary users - access team features based on plan
# - DIRECT USERS (team owners): Full access to configure team features
# - ENTERPRISE USERS: Cannot access (separate enterprise features)
#
# PLAN-BASED FEATURES:
# - Features available based on team's subscription plan (Free, Starter, Pro, Enterprise)
# - Plan features loaded from team.plan_features
# - Different feature sets for different subscription tiers
# - Feature access controlled by billing status
#
# FEATURE MANAGEMENT:
# - Feature requests: Allow members to request new features
# - Feature configuration: Team-specific settings for enabled features
# - Feature access: Control which features are available to team
# - Feature usage tracking: Monitor feature adoption and usage
#
# SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
# - Skips Pundit authorization (features are team-scoped by nature)
# - Feature access controlled by subscription plan and team membership
# - No cross-team feature access (team scope enforced by BaseController)
# - Feature configuration changes should be logged for audit purposes
#
